# 🚀 APEX PLATFORM: The Next-Generation Multi-Tenant SaaS Ecosystem

Welcome to the **APEX Platform**. This is not just a software project; it is a high-performance, strictly engineered SaaS infrastructure designed to power 1,000,000+ tenants with absolute isolation, zero-trust security, and hyper-scalability.

---

## 🏛️ Project Architecture (Triple-Lock Protocol)
APEX follows a strict **Atomic Unit** philosophy. Every feature is delivered across three mandatory layers:
1.  **Frontend (UI/UX)**: Located in `apps/`
2.  **Backend (API/Logic)**: Located in `packages/` or `services/`
3.  **Database (Schema)**: Located in `prisma/`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **"One Layer is a Crime."** Never commit a frontend change without its matching backend logic and data model.

## 📜 Core Documentation (Mandatory Reading)
Before contributing, you **must** read and agree to the following protocols. Failure to follow these results in immediate PR rejection.

-   [**Engineering Protocol**](./ENGINEERING_PROTOCOL.md): The technical contract (No `any`, Tenant Isolation, Security).
-   [**Contribution Guide**](./CONTRIBUTING.md): How we build features at APEX.
-   [**Pull Request Template**](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md): The mandatory checklist for every delivery.
-   [**System Anatomy Setup**](./SYSTEM_ANATOMY_SETUP.md): Initial setup and monorepo rules.

## 🌐 Remote Deployment (GCP)
The platform is deployed on a dedicated external server with isolated port mapping.

- **Server IP**: `34.18.154.179`
- **Environment**: Isolated `apex_admin` user.
- **Port Range**: `7000 - 7020`

| MinIO Console | 7003 | 9001 |
